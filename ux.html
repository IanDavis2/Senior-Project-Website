    <h1>User Experience</h1>
    <h2>Difference Between User Experience and Usability</h2>
    <p>User experience refers to how well the product is able to meet the needs and wants of the user. Usability is only one part of user experience. Usability is determined by whether or not 
        the system is efficient and easy to use, as well as enjoyable.</p>
    <h2>Elements of User Experience</h2>
    <p><b>Usability: </b>Usability is an important element of user experience. This element refers to how easy to use and intuitive the website and its features are.
    <b>Value: </b>It is also important that there is value in the website, so that there is a reason for users to use and stay on your website. Even with great usability, if there is
    nothing on the website that interests the user, it will not be a successful or useful website and the experience will not be worhtwhile.
    <b>Adoptability: </b>Adoptability refers to how easy and enjoyable it is to start using a product. The difference between usability and adoptability is that usability refers to the
    overall experience of the user, including both new and longtime users, adoptability only relates to new users. If your website is drastically different from others, it will be difficult
     for new users to udnerstand and get used to. This means it has poor adoptability.</p>
    <h2>Cognitive Load</h2>
    <p>Cognitive load is the amount of exertion your mind must undergo to use the website. There are two types of cognitive load - instrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic cognitive load is
    something that cannot be avoided, it is necessary for using any website. Extrinsic cognitive load, by contrast, can and shoudl be avoided when possible. One element of cognitive load
is the need to memorize certain pieces of information, such as passwords. If you can minimize the amount of information that must be memorize, you can reduce the cognitive load on the 
user. Another way to reduce cognitive load is by making bots or the website itself perform tasks that they can, so that the tasks of the user are trimmed down to the essentials.</p>
