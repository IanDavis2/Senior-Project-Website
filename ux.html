    <h1>User Experience</h1>
    <h2>Difference Between User Experience and Usability</h2>
    <p>User experience refers to how well the product is able to meet the needs and wants of the user. Usability is only one part of user experience. Usability is determined by whether or not 
        the system is efficient and easy to use, as well as enjoyable.</p>
    <h2>Elements of User Experience</h2>
    <p><b>Usability: </b>Usability is an important element of user experience. This element refers to how easy to use and intuitive the website and its features are.<br> 
    <b>Value: </b>It is also important that there is value in the website, so that there is a reason for users toi use and stay on your website. Even with great usability, if there is <br>
    nothing on the website that interests the user, it will not be a successful or useful website and the experience will not be worhtwhile.
    <b>Adoptability: </b>Adoptability refers to how easy and enjoyable it is to start using a product. The difference between usability and adoptability is that usability refers to the <br>
    overall experience of the user, including both new and longtime users, adoptability only relates to new users. If your website is drastically different from others, it will be difficult<br>
     for new users to udnerstand and get used to. This means it has poor adoptability.</p>
