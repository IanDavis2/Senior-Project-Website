    <b>Pagination:</b> Pagination divides the content of the website into multiple pages (usually numbered) and allows the user to skip to any page by clicking
    the box with the page's assigned number.<br>
    <b>Icons:</b> Icons are symbols of a particular page that allow users to easily recognize them and their association with the page should seem intuitive.<br>

    <b>Track Bar:</b> A track bar, or slider, allows the user to adjust a specific value using a scrolling point on a line, rather than typing in the value directly.<br>

    <b>Breadcrumbs:</b> Breadcrumbs are a 'trail' of previous pages the user has visited before their current one, which links to the previous pages so that the
     user can retrace their steps.</p><br>
    <h2>Input Controls</h2>

    <b>Dropdown Lists:</b> These allow users to choose one option at a time in a compact manner.<br>
