    <p><b>Search Box:</b> Also known as a search field, this is a box in which the user may enter words to get results back from the search engine or website.<br>
    <b>Pagination:</b> Pagination divides the content of the website into multiple pages (usually numbered) and allows the user to skip to any page by clicking the box with the page's assigned number.<br>
    <b>Icons:</b> Icons are symbols of a particular page that allow users to easily recognize them and their association with the page should seem intuitive.<br>
    <b>Tags:</b> Tags show the user pages in the same category as what they have looked at, which allows them to more easily find pages relevant to them.</p>
