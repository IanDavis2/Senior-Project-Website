    <h1>User Interface</h1>
    <h2>Navigational Components</h2>
    <p><b>Search Box:</b> Also known as a search field, this is a box in which the user may enter words to get results back from the search engine or website.<br>
    <b>Pagination:</b> Pagination divides the content of the website into multiple pages (usually numbered) and allows the user to skip to any page by clicking <br>
    the box with the page's assigned number.<br>
    <b>Icons:</b> Icons are symbols of a particular page that allow users to easily recognize them and their association with the page should seem intuitive.<br>
    <b>Tags:</b> Tags show the user pages in the same category as what they have looked at, which allows them to more easily find pages relevant to them.<br>
    <b>Track Bar:</b> A track bar, or slider, allows the user to adjust a specific value using a scrolling point on a line, rather than typing in the value directly.<br>
    <b>Image Carousel:</b> An image carousel is a series of images users may scroll through and select, the images are often hyperlinked and lead to other pages.<br>
    <b>Breadcrumbs:</b> Breadcrumbs are a 'trail' of previous pages the user has visited before their current one, which links to the previous pages so that the<br>
     user can retrace their steps.<br></p>
