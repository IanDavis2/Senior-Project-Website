    <h2>What is User Interface?</h2>
    <p>The user interface is the interaction between the computer and the user. Display screens and other features are considered to be a part of the user interface.
        It also refers to the way the user interacts with the computer, application, or website. The features which are interactive or infromative are generally
        included in the user interface.</p>

         the site must be easy and convenient to use (usability), desirable, and accessable. These are the bases of a good user experience.</p>
